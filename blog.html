        Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
    </h1>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="font-bold">var: </span>
                Variables declared with var are function-scoped. 
                This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared. 
                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope.
            </li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">let: </span>
                Variables declared with let are block-scoped. 
                They are only accessible within the block in which they are declared, such as inside a loop or conditional statement. 
                Variables declared with let are not hoisted. They are only accessible after their declaration in the code.
            </li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">const: </span>
                Variables declared with const are block-scoped. 
                Variables declared with const must be assigned a value when declared, and that value cannot be changed later. 
                It creates a constant reference to the value, but the variable itself is not reassign-able.

        <ul>
            <li><span class="font-bold">NULL: </span>
                    It is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value or a placeholder for a value that should be empty. 
                    It can be used to clear references to objects, allowing them to be garbage collected. 
                    It can be used in comparisons to check if a variable has been deliberately set to no value.
            </li>
            <li><span class="font-bold">Undefined: </span>
                    Variables that are declared but not assigned a value are automatically initialized to undefined. This is often used as a default value.
                    When a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are undefined. 
                    If you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns undefined.

                stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. 
                It is a set of guidelines and standards that permit various software programs to speak to one another and exchange information via the Internet. 
                It is frequently used for developing web services that can be accessed by different clients, such as online and mobile applications, and uses conventional HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to conduct operations on resources (such as data or services).
